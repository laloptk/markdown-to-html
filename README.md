# Markdown to HTML in real time using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

## Description 

This app turns markdown text into HTML. It uses Redux as a way to manage state because I built this to practice React and Redux, but Redux is not necessary to manage the state of an app this small.

## Make it run

Once you clone this repo into your local computer go to your terminal and run the following commands in the root folder of your project:

```npm install```
```npm start```
